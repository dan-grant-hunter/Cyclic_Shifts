# Cyclic Shifts

## How the program works

1. User is prompted to enter in a string of text containing only capital letters

2. User is then prompted to enter in another string of text containing only capital letters

3. Program will then output either Yes or No depending on if any cyclic shifts of the second string are present in the first string

4. Finally, the user is prompted if they would like to try again
